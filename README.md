# Occurrances-of-words
This project searches for the number of occurrences, of the type word you input. I added a ".txt", named "The Gray Nun", however you may also, test this out with any ".txt" file of your liking, the only change you have to do is, open the "test.py" and change the-( K = open) title, then run the code via "main.py".
